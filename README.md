Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the art of designing, maintaining and making scalable software solutions.
- **efficiency** - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
- **scalability** - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- AI and machine learning
- cloud computing and microservices
- Devops

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- requirement analysis - analysing what is required to see what is needed to accomplish the task at hand.
- coding - this is the implimentation phase
- testing - looking at the software solution to see if it works as expected
- design - building the frameworks 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall method - inear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
- Agile method -  Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer does the making of software.
- A quality assurance engineer is a person that ensures that the software meets the standards.
- project manager ensures that the project deadlines are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code.
and version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time like  Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- rapid evolving technologies
- time contraints
- software security

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit testing
- integration testing
- system testing

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions to AI to generate the best and optimum solution.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- help me debug.
- help me debug a syntax error that is here in this code [provided code].
  - clarity - ensure that the prompt is very concise and detailed to the point it the AI model enderstands and produces the best output.
  - detailed - ensure that the details or what i want to do is very detailed to inch perfect.
